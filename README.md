## Git

Git is fun, except when it's not.

### Git-related Terms

Local master branch = master_
Remote master branch = origin/master_
PR = "pull request"

### Git Workflow

1. Start from your master via GitHub Desktop
2. Pull the latest from origin/master
3. Create a new branch
4. Commit as many changes as you'd like on your new local branch
5. While on your new local branch, pull the latest from origin/master whenever new changes are made
6. Before pushing your new local branch to origin/master for a PR submission, be sure to pull the latest from origin/master
7. Push your new local branch to origin/master
8. Submit a PR via browser of your choice (most likely Chrome)
9. Repeat steps 4 to 7 as much as you'd like; the PR will automatically be updated with any commits pushed to origin/master
10. Once your PR is approved, merge your branch into origin/master
11. Do a happy dance!

Will update this section if any steps aren't clear. -LL
